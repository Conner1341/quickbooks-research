only 7 reviews - 3/7 5 stars, 3/7 1 star and 1/7 3 stars

Cons noted in reviews: 

- integration is poor
- creates sales drafts for every edited opportunity, despite being config'd to only bring in closed opportunities
- creates drafts for old opp records every time an old opp is edited or an account is merged with an old opp
- Documentation is not good, needs more work
- no support
- API built for one purpose and lacks any flexibility
- App is broken w/ no fix in site (1/21/21 - note that other reviews have since been published)
- Accountant and WholeSale clients not supported

Pros noted in reviews:

- Fairly easy to set up if you have experience working with APIs
- Works as intended and does its job well
- will be useful once functionality is expanded
